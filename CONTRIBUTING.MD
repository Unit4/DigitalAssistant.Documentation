# Making contributions to Unit4 People Platform documentation

Thanks for being interested in contributing to the Unit4 People Platform documentation and this guide covers what you need to know. To make contributions you must have a GitHub account which is free and easy to create.

The Unit4 People Platform documentation is hosted on GitHub and is open source with public-facing repositories. This allows our users to contribute directly to our documentation and communicate with our developer teams via pull requests.

The documentation is written using Markdown which is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text. If you're new to Markdown then see [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more details.

Each topic on the Unit4 People Platform documentation website includes an **Edit this topic** button to allow you to suggest changes. When you click this button, the corresponding source file is opened in GitHub for you to edit.

#### Making quick edits

4. Create a pull request to ask the owners of the repository to "pull" your changes into their repository. If you're new to GitHub, see [About Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for more information..
